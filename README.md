# VDAPP - Vesting DApp


# Description
VDAPP is a decentralized application (DApp) designed for vesting tokens by an organization. It allows tokens to be vested over a specific duration, after which they can be claimed by the intended recipients. In case the recipients are unable to claim their vested tokens, the admin has the capability to claim them on their behalf.

## Features

- **Token Vesting**: Tokens can be vested over a specified duration.
- **Claim Functionality**: Recipients can claim their vested tokens once the vesting duration is over.
- **Admin Claim**: Admin has the authority to claim tokens on behalf of recipients who are unable to claim them.
